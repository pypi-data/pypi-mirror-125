This python module "backrooms" is a Esolang.

Backrooms is inspired by:
    * Backrooms Creepypasta/MEME
    * ASCIIDOTS Esolang
    * CISC Architecture

Backrooms is designed to be:
    * Hackable VIA memory overflow attacks and poor error handling.
    * Visually pleasing.
    * Enjoyable to write small/medium programs.
    * Capable of rewriting all of a program at run-time.

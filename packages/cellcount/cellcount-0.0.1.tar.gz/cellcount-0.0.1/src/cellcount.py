"""
This package takes a 2-dimensional binary array (0,1), and returns
the number of individually contiguous regions in that array which
contain the value of 1.

Usage:
    cellCount() accepts either a list or a numpy ndarray of 2 dimensions
    
    Example:
        import cellcount as cc

        number_of_cells = cc.countCells(img_array)

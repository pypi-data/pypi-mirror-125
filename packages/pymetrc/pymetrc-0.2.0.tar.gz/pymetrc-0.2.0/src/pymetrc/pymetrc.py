class Metrc:
    '''
    A class to represent a Metrc client object. Contained within is a both a vendor API key and a unique user API key
    required for authentication with the Metrc REST API service. This allows for segmentation if using with multiple
    keys which may be necessary for a variety of reasons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vendor_api_key : str
        Software vendor API key provided by Metrc upon validating that correct queries can be made.
    user_api_key : str
        API key tied to an individual which allows for access control and permissions for various subsets of related
        tasks within the state traceability system.
    state : str
        Two-letter state abbreviation for loading correct endpoints.

    Attributes
    ----------
    endpoints : dict
        Contains endpoint type (key) and a list of the associated endpoint url stubs (value). Several contain "{id}"
        which is modified via a string replace method to insert individual IDs.
    vendor_api_key : str
        Description in Parameters section above.
    user_api_key : str
        Description in Parameters section above.
    facility_data : list[dict]
        Facilities and all associated information as returned via the API.
    facilities : list[str]
        Facilities parsed from facility_data for easy access.
    dispensaries : list[str]
        Facilities that are identified as dispensaries.
    mipps : list[str]
        Facilities that are identified for manufacturing and processing.
    providers : list[str]

        Get a list of transactions for a provided list of receipt IDs, or use a sales datetime range to first trigger a

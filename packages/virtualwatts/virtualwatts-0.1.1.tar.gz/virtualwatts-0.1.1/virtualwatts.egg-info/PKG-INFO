Description: VirtualWatts is a software-defined power meter based on the PowerAPI toolkit.
        VirtualWatts a configurable software that can estimate the power consumption of
        process inside a VM in real-time.
        VirtuallWatts is supposed to be used inside a VM. It need to receive two metrics :
        
        - The energy consumption of the VM, usually made with
          [SmartWatts](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/smartwatts-formula)
        - The cpu usage of the tracked processes and the global cpu usage, as provided
          by [procfs-sensor](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/procfs-sensor).

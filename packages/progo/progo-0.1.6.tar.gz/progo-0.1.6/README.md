# Frequently Asked Questions

- WTF would you do this?
    - I bought a Hero10 and wanted to see how it works. And what can be done with it.
    - I also wanted an excuse to use [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/index.html).

- What model of GoPro is this compatible with?
    - Hero10 (Open GoPro API 2.0)
    - Older models (Open GoPro API 1.0), but with some functionality degradation (shutter/encoding control).

- Does it work with more than one camera?
    - Good question! If you send me another Hero10 I'll make sure it works ðŸ˜‰.

Description: # Colorain
        Ever wondered how people make those console programmes print in pretty colours? Well, the answer is simple: there are colour codes with which you have to tag up the text. The problem is, the codes are pretty complicated, and so typically people write bland, all-whites console programmes. Colorain is a package that makes printing coloured text to the console a piece of cake. Using a simple markup designed just for colouring text on the terminal, Colorain allows you to quickly add colours to any Python project you might have. There's a few other packages that help you to print colourful text with Python, but none with the ease of use as Colorain.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install colorain
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        from colorain import *
        # parses the colour tags and colour-codes the text as needed
        txt = ColoredText('`f|y`Okay`f|n`, workin `f|c`fine`f|n`') 
        
        # prints the coloured text
        print(txt) 
        
        # strips off the colour tags and gives the raw text
        print(txt.raw_text()) 
        
        print(txt + FGRed("\nOr is it?"))
        ```

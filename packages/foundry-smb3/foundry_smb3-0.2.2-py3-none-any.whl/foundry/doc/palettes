# NES Colors

The NES has a color table consisting of 64 possible colors. Not all of them are
unique, however, which results in less than 64 possible colors, that can be
used.

These colors can be addressed using the indexes 0x00 to 0x3F.

# Color palettes

Palettes consists of 3 colors and a background-color which is the same in every
palette of a level.

The colors are defined as bytes, containing an index to the NES color table.

# Level palettes

These level palettes are not organized by Worlds, but rather by the object set,
that they are using, e. g. desert or plains. Each object set has 8 groups of
4 level palettes available for use.

That means that each level can only use 4 different palettes. Every block of a
level is associated with one of these palettes and is colored with the colors
defined by it.

# Enemy palettes

Every object set also has 4 groups of 4 color palettes, which can be used to
color enemies. As with the level palettes, a level can also only have one enemy
palette from its object set.

# Size and Location in ROM

Since every palette takes up 4 bytes, every palette group has 4 palettes and
there are 8 level groups + 4 enemy groups, palette data for an object set is
(8 + 4) * 4 * 4 = 192 bytes long.

The starting address of all the level palettes is #36CA2.

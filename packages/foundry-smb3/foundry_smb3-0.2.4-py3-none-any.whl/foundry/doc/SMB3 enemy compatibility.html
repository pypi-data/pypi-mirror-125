<h1>SMB3 enemy compatibility</h1>

<p>
Compiled by <b>Spinzig</b>.

</p><p>
Clan 1 are enemies that work with the all the clans but not other groups within
clan 1 (eg. Dry Bones doesn't work with Koopas).

</p><p>
Clan 2 are compatible with every Clan 1 enemy but not other groups of Clan 2
(eg. you can have either Spike and Dry Bones or Spike and a Koopa, but you
can't have Spike and a Lakitu).

</p><p>
Clan 3 are bosses that use tiles from both clans. They're not compatible with
anything as far as I know. I still don't know if there are enemies that work
with them.

</p><h2>Loose ends</h2>

<p>
There are a few things I'm not sure of.

</p><ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Firstly, Boom-Boom works with flying Boom-Boom, but if you kill
	Boom-Boom, the crystal ball with make Boom-Boom glitch until you hit
	him and he stops flying. He looks like a glitchy Dry Bones, so I think
	the crystal ball may be in another class.
	</li><li>The Sun may be in the Koopa Kid class. I think he works with them.
	</li><li>Ptooies and Moving Ptooies are half-compatible with some groups.
	Pipe Ptooies are just Piranha plants, so they actually work with other
	clan 2 enemies (but their spiked ball glitches). Moving ones have the
	head of a Piranha plant and a different body, so they don't work with
	other clan 2 enemy groups as well.
	</li><li>In Mario Allstars, the groups are completely different, and I
	think level specific, like Mario World.
	</li><li>I found a good way to have multiple groups in levels is space
	them out and put blocks or something so they cannot meet and glitch
	each other. Shelled enemies like Buzzies are good in water as then
	they can't be stomped in there, and the shell cannot be carried over
	to an enemy that may glitch. I guess people may not mind a few small
	glitches, so this isn't a major thing, but it helps levels maintain
	a more professional look.
	</li><li>There are still unused sprites that look glitched no matter what.
	I don't know what these are.
</li></ol>

<p>
That's all for now. Hope that helps!

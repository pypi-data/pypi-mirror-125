Description: Ligature is a Python library that builds up ways of stitching data together.
        
        It builds from low to high level abstractions, demonstrating how they work together.
        
        The goal is to make data composable, but also to make sure it's clear exactly what is being done at any given stage.
        
        The core functionality:
         - RecordSets form the core of Ligature. A list of tuples of tuples, this provides a framework for chunky updates in a (mostly) immutable data structure.
         - Scanners iterate RecordSets and provide iterators that scan RecordSets in a column-like way while still maintaining row-based chunks.
         - Transforms and Composables allow Scanners to be mapped to RecordSets and perform generator-like updates, creating new RecordSets and making chains of calculations possible. These are evaluated lazily by default, allowing data to be updated and computed in asynchronous chunks and resolved on demand (if desired).

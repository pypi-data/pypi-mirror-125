# Python Aternos API
An unofficial Aternos API written in Python.  
It uses requests, cloudscraper and lxml to parse data from [aternos.org](https://aternos.org/).
> Note for vim: if you have a problem like `IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level`, try out `retab`.

## Using
First you need to install the module:
```bash
pip install python-aternos
```

To use Aternos API in your Python script, import it and  
login with your username and password (or MD5 hash of password).  
> Note: Logging in with Google or Facebook account is not supported yet.

Then get the servers list using the `servers` field.  
You can start/stop your Aternos server now, calling `start()` or `stop()`.

There is an example how to use the Aternos API:
```python
# Import
from python_aternos import Client

# Log in
#aternos = Client('USERNAME', password='PASSWORD')
aternos = Client('example', password='test123')
# ----OR----
#aternos = Client('USERNAME', md5='HASHED_PASSWORD')
aternos = Client('example', md5='cc03e747a6afbbcbf8be7668acfebee5')

# get_servers returns AternosServer list
atservers = aternos.servers

# If you have only one server, get it by 0 index
myserv = atservers[0]

# Start
myserv.start()
# Stop
myserv.stop()

# You can also find server by IP
testserv = None
for serv in atservers:
    if serv.address == 'test.aternos.org':
        testserv = serv
if testserv != None:
    # Prints a server softaware and its version
    # (for example, "Vanilla 1.12.2")
    print(testserv.software, testserv.version)
    # Starts server
    testserv.start()
```

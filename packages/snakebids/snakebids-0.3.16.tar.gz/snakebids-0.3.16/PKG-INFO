        This package allows you to build BIDS Apps using Snakemake. It offers:
        
        
        * Flexible data grabbing with PyBIDS, configurable solely by config file entries
        * Helper function for creating BIDS paths inside Snakemake workflows/rules
        * Command-line invocation of snakemake workflows with BIDS App compliance
        * Configurable argument parsing specified using the Snakemake workflow config
        * Execution either as command-line BIDS apps or via snakemake executable

This is a tool to download and convert novels from popular sites to e-books.

> **v0.7.+ is not compatible with previous versions**

## Install

```bash
pip install novelsave
```

or

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mensch272/novelsave.git
```

## Usage

### Basic

To download and package the novel in a single line use the following command:

```bash
novelsave process <id_or_url>
```

The most common commands you'll be using are:

#### `update`

The command requires the url of the id of the novel as an argument. When the novel has been identified it attempts to update the current novel information in the following steps:

1. Download the novel webpage.
2. Update the novel information. This includes title, author and pending chapters.
3. Identify the chapters with no content and download and update them.
4. Download any assets that require to be downloaded (assets are identified during chapter download).

Note that, if url is provided and the novel does not already exist in the database, a new novel entry will be created.

For more information, run

```bash
novelsave update --help
```

#### `package`

The command requires the url of the id of the novel as an argument. When novel is identified compiles the downloaded content into the specified formats.

Specify a compilation target using the `--target` option. If option is not provided
compiles to only epub.

Or you may use `--target-all` to package to all supported formats.

```bash
novelsave package <id_or_url> --target epub --target web
```

Supported compilation targets:

`epub` `html` `mobi` `pdf` `azw3` `text`

For more information, run

```bash
novelsave package --help
```

#### `process`

The command requires the url of the id of the novel as an argument. This is a combination of the above two commands, `update` and `package`.

This is a command of convenience, to update and package in a single command.

For more information, run

```bash
novelsave process --help
```

```bash

```

novelsave config reset novel.dir
```

All supported configurations are:

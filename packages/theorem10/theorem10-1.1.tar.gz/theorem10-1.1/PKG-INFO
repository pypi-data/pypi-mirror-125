        ### Demonstration
        
        ```python
        import theorem10
        x=4 # we took x=4 as an example, for number of form 10^x 
        num_bits=theorem10.get_bits(x)  # here, we pass x to get_bits function, and it returns number of bits 
                                        # that will always represent total numbers greater than 10^x
        ```
        
        ### PyPi package installation
        
        ```
        pip3 install theorem10
        ```
        
        ```python

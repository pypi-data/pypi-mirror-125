## Installation

To install this module, which is currently **NOT** released on [pypi](https://pypi.org) yet, you need
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed and added to PATH.

If you do have git installed, follow this to install the module

```shell
git clone https://github.com/andrewthederp/Disgames.git
cd Disgames
python setup.py install
```

Note that this works with the now discontinued module [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord) and we
will make it compatible with other modules as soon as possible

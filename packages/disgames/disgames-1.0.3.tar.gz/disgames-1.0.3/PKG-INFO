        ## Installation
        
        To install this module, which is currently **NOT** released on [pypi](https://pypi.org) yet, you need
        [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed and added to PATH.
        
        If you do have git installed, follow this to install the module
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/andrewthederp/Disgames.git
        cd Disgames
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Note that this works with the now discontinued module [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord) and we
        will make it compatible with other modules as soon as possible

# # 🥭 MarketOperations
#
# This file deals with placing orders. We want the interface to be simple and basic:
# ```
# market_operations.cancel_order(old_order)
# market_operations.place_order(new_order)
# ```
# This requires the `MarketOperations` already know a bit about the market it is placing the
# order on, and the code in the `MarketOperations` be specialised for that market platform.
#

# # 🥭 MarketOperations class
#
# This abstracts the process of placing orders, providing a base class for specialised operations.
#
# It's abstracted because we may want to have different approaches to placing these
# orders - do we want to run them against the Serum orderbook? Do we want to run them against
# Mango groups?
#
# Whichever choice is made, the calling code shouldn't have to care. It should be able to
# use its `MarketOperations` class as simply as:
# ```
# market_operations.place_order(order)
# ```

        ====
        
        Firebase Adapter is the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) adapter for [PyCasbin](https://github.com/casbin/pycasbin). With this library, Casbin can load policy from Firebase Firestore or save policy to it.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install pycasbin_firebase_adapter
        ```
        
        ## Simple Example
        
        ```python
        import pycasbin_firebase_adapter
        import casbin
        
        adapter = pycasbin_firebase_adapter.Adapter('path/to/services.json')
        
        e = casbin.Enforcer('path/to/model.conf', adapter, True)
        
        sub = "alice"  # the user that wants to access a resource.
        obj = "data1"  # the resource that is going to be accessed.
        act = "read"  # the operation that the user performs on the resource.
        
        if e.enforce(sub, obj, act):
            # permit alice to read data1casbin_sqlalchemy_adapter
            pass
        else:
            # deny the request, show an error
            pass
        ```

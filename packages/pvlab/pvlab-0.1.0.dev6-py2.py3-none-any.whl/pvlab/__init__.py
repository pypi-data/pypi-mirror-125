The package ``pvlab``provides tools for solar sensors and pv devices.

PVLAB is a project devoted to the development and improvement of scientific
software for the measurement, calibration and modeling of the performance of
photoltaic devices and solar sensors. PVLAB package was born from the efforts
made to perform the data treatment for the calibration of pyranometers at
the Laboratory of Photovoltaic Solar Energy (PVLAb), in the Research Center
for Energy, Environment and Technology (CIEMAT) in Madrid, Spain. The aim of
PVLAB is to provide a set of tools, mainly consisting in classes and
functions, to perform the data treatment for the calibration of pyranometers.

It is partially based on the [*tsviz*](https://github.com/xtreamsrl/tsviz) R package.\n\nThe *utils* module contains a set of useful utilities, not strictly related to visualization, we often use (e.g. harmonics computation).\n\nThe *viz* module contains functions for plotting univariate time series, as well as performing quick qualitative analyses such as decompositions, correlations and so on.\n\nSome visualizations mimic the R packages *ggplot2* and *forecast*, as presented in the textbook *Forecasting: principles and practice* by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.\nThe online version of the text can be found [here](https://otexts.com/fpp3/).\n\n## Install\n\nThe preferred way to install the package is using pip, but you can also download the code and install from source\n\nTo install the package using pip:\n\n```shell\npip install pytsviz\n```\n\n## Develop\n\nAfter cloning, you need to install and setup Poetry. See [instructions](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation).\n\nThen, inside the project directory, run:\n\n```shell\npoetry install\npre-commit install\n```\n\nThen, you\'re good to go.\n\nYou\'re free to submit your pull requests. Just make sure they follow [conventional commit rules](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification). This can be enforced by the [*commitizen*](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) tool, which is also included among the package dependencies.\n\nPlease also make sure that function documentation is consistent. We are currently using [Sphinx docstrings](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html).\n\n\n## Who we are\n<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38501645?s=450&u=1eb7348ca81f5cd27ce9c02e689f518d903852b1&v=4">\nA proudly ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ software development and data science startup.<br>We consider ourselves a family of talented and passionate people building their own products and powerful solutions for our clients.

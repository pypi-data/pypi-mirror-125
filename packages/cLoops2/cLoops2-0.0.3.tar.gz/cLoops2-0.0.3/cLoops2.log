Plot the interaction data as a heatmap (or arches/scatter) with additional of 
virtual 4C view point, 1D tracks (bigWig files), 1D annotations (peaks, genes) 
and 2D annotations (domains). If -f is not assigned, will just plot profiles 
from bigWig file or bed files.

Examples:
    1. plot the simple square heatmap for a specific region with 1kb resolution 
       with genes 
        cLoops2 plot -f test/chr21-chr21.ixy -o test -bs 1000 -start 34840000 \
                     -end 34895000 -log -gtf test.gtf

    2. plot the upper triangle heatmap with domains such as TAD and CTCF bigWig
       track

                     -start 34600000 -end 35500000 -domains HiC_TAD.bed -log \
                    -triu -bws GM12878_CTCF_chr21.bw

    3. plot the heatmap as upper triangle with 1D signal track and filter the 
       PETs shorter than 1kb
        cLoops2 plot -f test/chr21-chr21.ixy -o test -bs 500 -start 34840000 \
                     -end 34895000 -log -triu -1D -cut 1000

    4. plot the observation/expectation interaction heatmap with 1D signal 
        cLoops2 plot -f test/chr21-chr21.ixy -o test -m obs/exp -1D -triu \ 
                     -bs 500 -start 34840000 -end 34895000

    5. plot the chromosome-wide correlation heatmap 
        cLoops2 plot -f test/chr21-chr21.ixy -o test -corr 

    6. plot upper triangle interaction heatmap together with genes, bigWig 
       files, peaks, loops, domains, control the heatmap scale

  -aw AW                Line width for each PET in arches plot. Default is 1. Try to

                        inactivate or activate histone markers, as actually the PCA values do
                        not have directions, especially comparing different samples.
  -figWidth {4,8}       Figure width. 4 is good to show the plot as half of a A4 figure
                        width and 8 is good to show more wider. Default is 4.

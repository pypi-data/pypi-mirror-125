    Class providing 2 public methods: cache_news and get_cached_news. Because caching works every time after getting
    and parsing an XML page, its instance's method cache_news is called every time the program runs. Whenever --date
    argument with a date in the format '20211020' is provided, the news specified by this date is returned from cache
    file as a list of feeds because different feeds may have news published on the same date. Due to the fact that in
    different RSS channels items may have different format of <pubDate> tag, it may be hard to programmatically
    convert its time value to our format in order to perform comparison, that's why there is a class field
    valid_date_formats, which defines legit date formats the application can distinguish. Whenever --date arguments
    is provided both with source argument, then the news published on the given date within this source are returned
    are returned from cache (if there are some).

# asitop

![](images/asitop.png)

```shell
pip install asitop
```

## What

A `nvtop`/`htop` style/inspired command line tool for Apple Silicon (aka M1) Macs.

Note that it requires `sudo` to run due to `powermetrics` needing root access to run.

```shell
# it will prompt you for password on start
asitop

# to enter password before start
sudo asitop
```

## Why

Because I didn't find something like this online.

## Disclaimers

I did this in a few hours don't blame me if it fried your new MacBook or something.

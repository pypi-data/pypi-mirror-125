        from goto import goto, label  # optional, for linter purpose
        
        @with_goto
        def x():
            goto .end
            print("this will not print")

            print("this will print")
        ```
        
        - use `label .NAME` to define a label.
        - use `goto .NAME` to goto into a label.

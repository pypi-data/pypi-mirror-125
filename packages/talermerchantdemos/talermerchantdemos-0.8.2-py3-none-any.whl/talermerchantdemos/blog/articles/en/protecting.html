<h2>Help Protect the Rights to Write Both Nonfree and Free Software</h2>

<blockquote><p>
The League for Programming Freedom is inactive now and its website is archived.
Please join our <a href="http://endsoftpatents.org">End Software Patents</a>
campaign!
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The right to write both nonfree and free software is threatened by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150329143651/http://progfree.org/Patents/patents.html">
software patents</a> and by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150329142315/http://progfree.org/Copyright/copyright.html">
&ldquo;look-and-feel&rdquo;
interface copyright lawsuits</a>.</p>

<p>
  The Free Software Foundation fights these threats in many ways.
  These include support for and being a member of
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150329224604/http://www.progfree.org/">
  League for Programming Freedom</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The League is a grass-roots organization of professors, students,
  business people, programmers, users, and even software companies
  dedicated to bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League
  isn't opposed to the legal system that Congress
  intended&mdash;copyright on individual programs.  The League aims to
  reverse recent changes made by judges in response to special
  interests.
</p>

<p>The FSF urges you to join us in fighting these threats by <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150329142830/http://progfree.org/Help/help.html">helping the League</a>.</p>

<p>
  <strong>The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation,
      and is not concerned with the issue of free software.</strong> The
  FSF supports the League because, like any software developer smaller
  than Microsoft, it is endangered by software patents, and interface
  copyrights.  You are in danger, too!  It would be easy to ignore the
  problem until you or your employer is sued, but it is more prudent to
  organize before that happens.

<!-- Regarding copyright, in general, standalone pages (as opposed to
     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 4.0.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->

<h2>Anonymous Payment by Phone</h2>

<p>by Richard Stallman</p>

<p>Here is an idea for an anonymous payment system that would be useful
for some applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>The seller sets up a phone number that charges N dollars per minute to
any caller.</li>

<li>The customer chooses a code, calls that number (which requires paying
N dollars), and enters the code. A voice-generation system speaks the
code back so the customer can confirm it.</li>

<li>That code represents a payment of N dollars. The customer enters it
in a web site, or a kiosk, and it constitutes payment for whatever.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be possible to do this using a phone card on a payphone
or anyone else's telephone.</p>

<h2>FSF Statement in Response to Proposed Revised Final Judgment
 in Microsoft vs. United States</h2>

  <p>January 28, 2002</p>

  <p>Renata B. Hesse<br />
  Antitrust Division<br />
  U.S. Department of Justice<br />
  601 D Street NW<br />
  Suite 1200<br />
  Washington, DC 20530-0001</p>

  <p>Dear Ms Hesse,</p>

  <p>I am Professor of Law at Columbia University Law School in New
  York, and General Counsel (<i>pro bono publico</i>) of the Free
  Software Foundation, a non-profit &sect;501(c)(3) corporation
  organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with
  its headquarters in Boston. I make this statement under the
  provisions of 15 U.S.C. &sect; 16(d) concerning the Proposed Revised
  Final Judgment (hereinafter &ldquo;the Settlement&rdquo;)
  in <i>United States v. Microsoft Corp</i>.</p>

  <p>The remedies sought to be effected in the Settlement are, in
  their broad outline, appropriate and reasonable measures for the
  abatement of the illegal conduct proven by the United States at
  trial. The goal of such remedies is to require that Defendant
  affirmatively assist the restoration of competition in the market in
  which the Defendant has been shown to have illegally maintained a
  monopoly in violation of 15 U.S.C. &sect;2. The remedies embodied in
  the Settlement would substantially achieve that goal, appropriately
  furthering the Government's pursuit of the public interest, if the
  Settlement were amended to rectify certain details one-sidedly
  favorable to the Defendant's goal of continuing its illegal
  monopoly.</p>

  <p>Defendant&mdash;in the interest of continuing unabated its
  illegal monopoly&mdash;has artfully drafted certain clauses of the
  Settlement so as to hobble potential competition, giving the
  appearance of affirmatively assisting to undo its wrong, but
  covertly assisting instead in its continuance.</p>

  <p>The District Court found that the Defendant had illegally
  maintained a monopoly in the market for Intel-compatible PC
  operating systems. (Findings of Fact, November 19, 1999, &para;19.)
  The mechanism of that monopolization, the court found, was the
  attempt to establish exclusive control of &ldquo;application program
  interfaces&rdquo; (&ldquo;APIs&rdquo;) to which applications
  developers resort for operating system services, so as to prevent
  the possibility of &ldquo;cross-platform&rdquo; development
  threatening Defendant's operating systems monopoly. (Findings of
  Fact, &para;80 and <i>passim</i>.)</p>

  <p>The Settlement accordingly makes appropriate provision to
  require Microsoft to provide access to full and complete
  technical information about its APIs on non-discriminatory terms,
  so as to prevent Defendant's prior conduct in erecting artificial
  and illegal barriers to entry to the monopolized market.</p>

  <p>But the precise terms of the Settlement create a series of
  artful technical loopholes vitiating the primary intention.</p>

  <p>Section III(D) provides that:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
    Starting at the earlier of the release of Service Pack 1 for
    Windows XP or 12 months after the submission of this Final
    Judgment to the Court, Microsoft shall disclose to ISVs, IHVs,
    IAPs, ICPs, and OEMs, for the sole purpose of interoperating with
    a Windows Operating System Product, via the Microsoft Developer
    Network (&ldquo;MSDN&rdquo;) or similar mechanisms, the APIs and
    related Documentation that are used by Microsoft Middleware to
    interoperate with a Windows Operating System Product. (emphasis
    added)
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The &ldquo;sole purpose&rdquo; requirement means that Defendant
  does not have to make any such API information available to
  developers of software whose purpose it is to make competing
  Intel-compatible PC operating systems. Only those who make programs
  that interoperate with Windows Operating Systems Products may
  receive such information. Under &sect; III(I)(3), an applications
  developer who has received licensed information concerning
  Defendant's APIs could be prohibiting from sharing that information
  with a maker of a competing Intel-compatible PC operating system,
  for the purpose of interoperating with that competing product. Under
  &sect;III(I)(2), if a potential competitor in the market for
  Intel-compatible PC operating systems also makes applications
  products, it can even be prohibited from using licensed information
  it receives in order to make those applications interoperate with
  Defendant's products also interoperate with its own competing
  operating system. 
<span class="gnun-split"></span>What should be a provision requiring Defendant to
  share information with potential competitors in the monopolized
  market turns out, after Defendant's careful manipulation, to be a
  provision for sharing information &ldquo;solely&rdquo; with people
  other than competitors in the monopolized market. The same language
  has been inserted into &sect;III(E), thus similarly perverting the
  intention of the Settlement with respect to Communications
  Protocols.</p>

  <p>Defendant has not merely engaged in this undertaking with a
  goal to the exclusion of potential future competitors from the
  monopolized market. In the teeth of the evidence, long after
  having been proved to have behaved with exaggerated contempt for
  the antitrust laws, Defendant is attempting in the very Judgment
  delivered against it to exclude from the market its most vigorous
  current competitor.</p>

  <p>Defendant's most significant present challenger in the
  Intel-compatible PC operating systems market is the collection of
  &ldquo;free software,&rdquo; which is free in the sense of freedom,
  not necessarily in price: thousands of programs written
  collaboratively by individuals and organizations throughout the
  world, and made available under license terms that allow everyone to
  freely use, copy, modify and redistribute all the program code. That
  free software, most of it licensed under the terms of the Free
  Software Foundation's GNU General Public License (&ldquo;the
  GPL&rdquo;) represents both an operating system, known as GNU, and
  an enormous corpus of applications programs that can run on almost
  all existing architectures of digital computers, including
  Intel-compatible PCs. 
<span class="gnun-split"></span>Through one such free software component, an
  operating system &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; called Linux, written by
  thousands of individuals and distributed under the GPL, the GNU
  operating system can execute on Intel-compatible PC's, and by
  combining Linux with other free software, GNU can perform all the
  functions performed by Windows. Non-Microsoft Middleware can execute
  on Intel-compatible PCs equipped with components of GNU and Linux.
  Intel-compatible PCs so equipped currently account for more than 30%
  of the installed server base in the United States, according to
  independent industry obsevers.</p>

  <p>The District Court found that &ldquo;by itself, Linux's
  open-source development model shows no signs of liberating that
  operating system from the cycle of consumer preferences and
  developer incentives that, when fueled by Windows' enormous
  reservoir of applications, prevents non-Microsoft operating systems
  from competing.&rdquo; (Findings of Fact, November 5, 1999,
  &para;50.)  (referring, confusingly, to the combination of GNU,
  Linux, and other programs simply as &ldquo;Linux.&rdquo;) The
  District Court correctly found that in order to compete effectively
  with Defendant in the desktop operating systems market for
  Intel-compatible PCs, systems equipped with the free software
  operating system should be able to interoperate with &ldquo;the
  enormous reservoir&rdquo; of Windows applications.</p>

  <p>There is no inherent barrier to such interoperation, only an
  artificial barrier illegally erected by Defendant. If Defendant were
  required to release information concerning its APIs to the
  developers of free software, GNU, Linux, the X windowing system, the
  WINE Windows emulator, and other relevant free software could
  interoperate directly with all applications that have been developed
  for Windows. Anyone could execute Windows applications programs
  bought from any developer on Intel-compatible PC's equipped with the
  competing free software operating system. And because, as the
  District Court found, the cost structure of free software is very
  much lower than Defendant's, the competing operating system product
  is and would continue to be available at nominal prices. (Findings
  of Fact, November 5, 1999, &para; 50.)</p>

  <p>That would be too effective a form of competition, from the
  Defendant's point of view. For this reason, Defendant has included
  in the Settlement the terms that exclude from API documentation
  precisely those to whom it would be most logically addressed:
  potential competitors seeking access to the monopolized market. If
  the Settlement were enforced according to its intention, the result
  would be immediate and vigorous competition between Defendant and
  the parties against whom, the District Court found, Defendant was
  illegally maintaining a barrier. The Settlement should be amended to
  level that barrier, which the current language inserted by Defendant
  artfully maintains. The language of &sect;&sect;III(D) and III(E)
  should be amended to require Defendant to release timely and
  accurate API information to all parties seeking to interoperate
  programs with either Windows Operating System Products or
  applications written to interoperate with Windows Operating System
  Products.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, Defendant's attempt to continue denying the
  free software development community access to its APIs through the
  imposition of royalty requirements, in &sect;III(I)(1), should be
  removed. As the District Court recognized, free software development
  means that everyone in the world has access, without payment of
  royalties or prohibition of redistribution, to the &ldquo;source
  code&rdquo; of the software. All APIs and other interfaces are fully
  available at all times to anyone who wants to interoperate with the
  existing programs. This, and the ability to reuse existing program
  code in new programs without payment of royalties or license fees,
  permits vast numbers of interoperable, high-quality programs to be
  written by a mixture of volunteers and professional project
  developers for free distribution. 
<span class="gnun-split"></span>By authorizing Defendant to engage
  in non-reciprocity by charging royalties for the same information
  about its programs, thus purposefully ousting volunteer developers,
  and by prohibiting &ldquo;sublicensing,&rdquo; thus precluding
  profit-making developers from seeking interoperability with
  volunteers, the Settlement is craftily perverted into a mechanism
  whereby Defendant can continue to withhold API information so as to
  preclude the operations of potential competitors. The Settlement
  should be modified so that &sect;III(I)(1) requires reciprocity, by
  precluding the imposition of royalties on developers who make their
  own APIs fully available without payment of royalties or license
  fees, and so that &sect;III(I)(3) precludes limitation on
  sublicensing, and requires Defendant to release API information on
  terms reciprocal to those on which competitors make their own API
  information available.</p>

  <p>In one additional provision Defendant has attempted to subvert
  the intention of the Settlement in order to preclude effective
  competition by the Intel-compatible free software operating
  system. Under &sect; III(J)(1), Defendant may refuse to disclose
  &ldquo;portions of APIs or Documentation or portions or layers of
  Communications Protocols the disclosure of which would compromise
  the security of anti-piracy, anti-virus, software licensing, digital
  rights management, encryption or authentication systems, including
  without limitation, keys, authorization tokens or enforcement
  criteria.&rdquo; This provision is so indefinite that Defendant can
  be expected to argue that all APIs and Communications Protocols
  connected with the security and authentication aspects of electronic
  commerce (including especially &ldquo;without limitation&rdquo; keys
  and authorization tokens, which are the basic building blocks of all
  electronic commerce systems) can be kept secret. 
<span class="gnun-split"></span>At present, all
  such protocols and APIs are public, which is appropriate
  because&mdash;as computer security experts would testify if, as it
  should, the District Court seeks evidentiary supplementation under
  15 U.S.C.  16(f)(1)&mdash;security is not attained in the computer
  communications field by the use of secret protocols, but rather by
  the use of scientifically-refereed and fully public protocols, whose
  security has been tested by full exposure in the scientific and
  engineering communities. 
<span class="gnun-split"></span>If this provision were enforced as
  currently drafted, Defendant could implement new private protocols,
  extending or replacing the existing public protocols of electronic
  commerce, and then use its monopoly position to exclude the free
  software operating system from use of that de facto industry
  standard embodied in its new unpublicized APIs and Protocols.
  Defendant then goes further in &sect; III(J)(2), according to itself
  the right to establish criteria of &ldquo;business viability&rdquo;
  without which it may deny access to APIs. Considering that its
  primary competition results from a development community led by
  non-profit organizations and relying heavily on non-commercial and
  volunteer developers, one can only conclude that Defendant is once
  again seeking the appearance of cooperation with the rule of law,
  while preparing by chicane to deny its injured competitors their
  just remedy.</p>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation not only authors and distributes
  the GNU General Public License, and in other ways facilitates the
  making of free software by others, it also manufactures and
  distributes free software products of its own, particularly the
  GNU operating system, and sells compilations of its own and
  others' free software. The Foundation sustains specific injury
  from the violations set forth in the complaint that are not
  remedied by (and indeed are specifically excluded from) the
  Settlement. The Foundation and the other free software developers
  with whom it acts are the single most significant competitor to
  the Defendant in the monopolized market, and the adoption of the
  Settlement as drafted, with its terms so carefully designed by
  Defendant to preclude its effective competition, would be a
  travesty. We urge that the Settlement be amended as we have
  described.</p>

  <p>Very truly yours,<br />
  Eben Moglen</p>

<h2>My Lisp Experiences and the Development of GNU Emacs</h2>

<blockquote><p>(Transcript of Richard Stallman's Speech, 28 Oct 2002, at the
International Lisp Conference).</p></blockquote>

<p>Since none of my usual speeches have anything to do with Lisp, none
of them were appropriate for today. So I'm going to have to wing it.
Since I've done enough things in my career connected with Lisp I
should be able to say something interesting.</p>

<p>My first experience with Lisp was when I read the Lisp 1.5 manual
in high school. That's when I had my mind blown by the idea that there
could be a computer language like that. The first time I had a chance
to do anything with Lisp was when I was a freshman at Harvard and I
wrote a Lisp interpreter for the <abbr title="Programmed Data
Processor">PDP</abbr>-11. It was a very small machine
&mdash; it had something like 8k of memory &mdash; and I managed to write the
interpreter in a thousand instructions. This gave me some room for a
little bit of data. That was before I got to see what real software
was like, that did real system jobs.</p>

<p>I began doing work on a real Lisp implementation with JonL White
once I started working at <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of
Technology">MIT</abbr>. I got hired at the Artificial Intelligence Lab
not by JonL, but by Russ Noftsker, which was most ironic considering
what was to come &mdash; he must have really regretted that day.</p>

<p>During the 1970s, before my life became politicized by horrible
events, I was just going along making one extension after another for
various programs, and most of them did not have anything to do with
Lisp. But, along the way, I wrote a text editor, Emacs. The
interesting idea about Emacs was that it had a programming language,
and the user's editing commands would be written in that interpreted
programming language, so that you could load new commands into your
editor while you were editing. You could edit the programs you were
using and then go on editing with them. So, we had a system that was
useful for things other than programming, and yet you could program it
while you were using it. I don't know if it was the first one of
those, but it certainly was the first editor like that.</p>

<p>This spirit of building up gigantic, complicated programs to use in
your own editing, and then exchanging them with other people, fueled
the spirit of free-wheeling cooperation that we had at the AI Lab
then. The idea was that you could give a copy of any program you had
to someone who wanted a copy of it. We shared programs to whomever
wanted to use them, they were human knowledge. So even though there
was no organized political thought relating the way we shared software
to the design of Emacs, I'm convinced that there was a connection
between them, an unconscious connection perhaps. I think that it's the
nature of the way we lived at the AI Lab that led to Emacs and made it
what it was.</p>

<p>The original Emacs did not have Lisp in it. The lower level
language, the non-interpreted language &mdash; was PDP-10
Assembler. The interpreter we wrote in that actually wasn't written
for Emacs, it was written for <abbr title="Text Editor and
COrrector">TECO</abbr>. It was our text editor, and was an
extremely ugly programming language, as ugly as could possibly be. The
reason was that it wasn't designed to be a programming language, it
was designed to be an editor and command language. There were commands
like &lsquo;5l&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;move five lines&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;i&rsquo; and then a string and then an ESC to insert that
string. You would type a string that was a series of commands, which
was called a command string. You would end it with ESC ESC, and it
would get executed.</p>

<p>Well, people wanted to extend this language with programming
facilities, so they added some. For instance, one of the first was a
looping construct, which was &lt; &gt;. You would put those around
things and it would loop. There were other cryptic commands that could
be used to conditionally exit the loop.  To make Emacs, we
<a href="#foot-1">(1)</a> added facilities to have subroutines with
names. Before that, it was sort of like Basic, and the subroutines
could only have single letters as their names. That was hard to
program big programs with, so we added code so they could have longer
names. Actually, there were some rather sophisticated facilities; I
think that Lisp got its unwind-protect facility
from TECO.</p>

<p>We started putting in rather sophisticated facilities, all with the
ugliest syntax you could ever think of, and it worked &mdash; people were
able to write large programs in it anyway. The obvious lesson was that
a language like TECO, which wasn't designed to be a
programming language, was the wrong way to go. The language that you
build your extensions on shouldn't be thought of as a programming
language in afterthought; it should be designed as a programming
language. In fact, we discovered that the best programming language
for that purpose was Lisp.</p>

<p>It was Bernie Greenberg, who discovered that it
was <a href="#foot-2">(2)</a>.  He wrote a version of Emacs in Multics
MacLisp, and he wrote his commands in MacLisp in a straightforward
fashion. The editor itself was written entirely in Lisp. Multics Emacs
proved to be a great success &mdash; programming new editing commands
was so convenient that even the secretaries in his office started
learning how to use it. They used a manual someone had written which
showed how to extend Emacs, but didn't say it was a programming. So
the secretaries, who believed they couldn't do programming, weren't
scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful
things and they learned to program.</p>

<p>So Bernie saw that an application &mdash; a program that does something
useful for you &mdash; which has Lisp inside it and which you could extend
by rewriting the Lisp programs, is actually a very good way for people
to learn programming. It gives them a chance to write small programs
that are useful for them, which in most arenas you can't possibly
do. They can get encouragement for their own practical use &mdash; at the
stage where it's the hardest &mdash; where they don't believe they can
program, until they get to the point where they are programmers.</p>

<p>At that point, people began to wonder how they could get something
like this on a platform where they didn't have full service Lisp
implementation. Multics MacLisp had a compiler as well as an
interpreter &mdash; it was a full-fledged Lisp system &mdash; but people wanted
to implement something like that on other systems where they had not
already written a Lisp compiler. Well, if you didn't have the Lisp
compiler you couldn't write the whole editor in Lisp &mdash; it would be
too slow, especially redisplay, if it had to run interpreted Lisp.  So
we developed a hybrid technique. The idea was to write a Lisp
interpreter and the lower level parts of the editor together, so that
parts of the editor were built-in Lisp facilities. Those would be
whatever parts we felt we had to optimize. This was a technique that
we had already consciously practiced in the original Emacs, because
there were certain fairly high level features which we re-implemented
in machine language, making them into TECO
primitives. For instance, there was a TECO
primitive to fill a paragraph (actually, to do most of the work of
filling a paragraph, because some of the less time-consuming parts of
the job would be done at the higher level by a TECO
program). You could do the whole job by writing
a TECO program, but that was too slow, so we
optimized it by putting part of it in machine language. We used the
same idea here (in the hybrid technique), that most of the editor
would be written in Lisp, but certain parts of it that had to run
particularly fast would be written at a lower level.</p>

<p>Therefore, when I wrote my second implementation of Emacs, I
followed the same kind of design. The low level language was not
machine language anymore, it was C. C was a good, efficient language
for portable programs to run in a Unix-like operating system. There
was a Lisp interpreter, but I implemented facilities for special
purpose editing jobs directly in C &mdash; manipulating editor buffers,
inserting leading text, reading and writing files, redisplaying the
buffer on the screen, managing editor windows.</p>

<p>Now, this was not the first Emacs that was written in C and ran on
Unix. The first was written by James Gosling, and was referred to as
GosMacs. A strange thing happened with him. In the beginning, he
seemed to be influenced by the same spirit of sharing and cooperation
of the original Emacs. I first released the original Emacs to people
at MIT. Someone wanted to port it to run on Twenex &mdash; it
originally only ran on the Incompatible Timesharing System we used
at MIT. They ported it to Twenex, which meant that there
were a few hundred installations around the world that could
potentially use it. We started distributing it to them, with the rule
that &ldquo;you had to send back all of your improvements&rdquo; so we
could all benefit. No one ever tried to enforce that, but as far as I
know people did cooperate.</p>

<p>Gosling did, at first, seem to participate in this spirit. He wrote
in a manual that he called the program Emacs hoping that others in the
community would improve it until it was worthy of that name. That's
the right approach to take towards a community &mdash; to ask them to join
in and make the program better. But after that he seemed to change the
spirit, and sold it to a company.</p>

<p>At that time I was working on the GNU system (a free software
Unix-like operating system that many people erroneously call
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;).  There was no free software Emacs editor that ran
on Unix. I did, however, have a friend who had participated in
developing Gosling's Emacs. Gosling had given him, by email, permission
to distribute his own version. He proposed to me that I use that
version. Then I discovered that Gosling's Emacs did not have a real
Lisp. It had a programming language that was known as
&lsquo;mocklisp&rsquo;, which looks syntactically like Lisp, but didn't
have the data structures of Lisp.  So programs were not data, and vital
elements of Lisp were missing.  Its data structures were strings,
numbers and a few other specialized things.</p>

<p>I concluded I couldn't use it and had to replace it all, the first
step of which was to write an actual Lisp interpreter. I gradually
adapted every part of the editor based on real Lisp data structures,
rather than ad hoc data structures, making the data structures of the
internals of the editor exposable and manipulable by the user's Lisp
programs.</p>

<p>The one exception was redisplay. For a long time, redisplay was
sort of an alternate world. The editor would enter the world of
redisplay and things would go on with very special data structures
that were not safe for garbage collection, not safe for interruption,
and you couldn't run any Lisp programs during that. We've changed that
since &mdash; it's now possible to run Lisp code during redisplay. It's
quite a convenient thing.</p>

<p>This second Emacs program was &lsquo;free software&rsquo; in the
modern sense of the term &mdash; it was part of an explicit political
campaign to make software free. The essence of this campaign was that
everybody should be free to do the things we did in the old days
at MIT, working together on software and working with
whomever wanted to work with us.  That is the basis for the free
software movement &mdash; the experience I had, the life that I've lived at
the MIT AI lab &mdash; to be working on human knowledge, and
not be standing in the way of anybody's further using and further
disseminating human knowledge.</p>

<p>At the time, you could make a computer that was about the same price
range as other computers that weren't meant for Lisp, except that it
would run Lisp much faster than they would, and with full type checking
in every operation as well. Ordinary computers typically forced you to
choose between execution speed and good typechecking.  So yes, you could
have a Lisp compiler and run your programs fast, but when they tried to
take <code>car</code> of a number, it got nonsensical results and eventually
crashed at some point.</p>

<p>The Lisp machine was able to execute instructions about as fast as
those other machines, but each instruction &mdash; a <code>car</code> instruction would
do data typechecking &mdash; so when you tried to get the <code>car</code> of a number
in a compiled program, it would give you an immediate error. We built
the machine and had a Lisp operating system for it. It was written
almost entirely in Lisp, the only exceptions being parts written in
the microcode. People became interested in manufacturing them, which
meant they should start a company.</p>

<p>There were two different ideas about what this company should be
like.  Greenblatt wanted to start what he called a
&ldquo;hacker&rdquo; company. This meant it would be a company run by
hackers and would operate in a way conducive to hackers. Another goal
was to maintain the AI Lab culture <a href="#foot-3">(3)</a>.
Unfortunately, Greenblatt didn't have any business experience, so
other people in the Lisp machine group said they doubted whether he
could succeed. They thought that his plan to avoid outside investment
wouldn't work.</p>

<p>Why did he want to avoid outside investment? Because when a company
has outside investors, they take control and they don't let you have
any scruples. And eventually, if you have any scruples, they also
replace you as the manager.</p>

<p>So Greenblatt had the idea that he would find a customer who would
pay in advance to buy the parts. They would build machines and deliver
them; with profits from those parts, they would then be able to buy
parts for a few more machines, sell those and then buy parts for a
larger number of machines, and so on. The other people in the group
thought that this couldn't possibly work.</p>

<p>Greenblatt then recruited Russell Noftsker, the man who had hired
me, who had subsequently left the AI Lab and created a successful
company.  Russell was believed to have an aptitude for business. He
demonstrated this aptitude for business by saying to the other people
in the group, &ldquo;Let's ditch Greenblatt, forget his ideas, and
we'll make another company.&rdquo; Stabbing in the back, clearly a
real businessman. Those people decided they would form a company
called Symbolics. They would get outside investment, not have
scruples, and do everything possible to win.</p>

<p>But Greenblatt didn't give up. He and the few people loyal to him
decided to start Lisp Machines Inc. anyway and go ahead with their
plans. And what do you know, they succeeded! They got the first
customer and were paid in advance. They built machines and sold them,
and built more machines and more machines. They actually succeeded
even though they didn't have the help of most of the people in the
group. Symbolics also got off to a successful start, so you had two
competing Lisp machine companies. When Symbolics saw that LMI was not
going to fall flat on its face, they started looking for ways to
destroy it.</p>

<p>Thus, the abandonment of our lab was followed by &ldquo;war&rdquo;
in our lab.  The abandonment happened when Symbolics hired away all
the hackers, except me and the few who worked at LMI part-time. Then
they invoked a rule and eliminated people who worked part-time
for MIT, so they had to leave entirely, which left only
me. The AI lab was now helpless.  And MIT had made a very
foolish arrangement with these two companies.  It was a three-way
contract where both companies licensed the use of Lisp machine system
sources. These companies were required to let MIT use
their changes. But it didn't say in the contract that MIT
was entitled to put them into the MIT Lisp machine
systems that both companies had licensed. Nobody had envisioned that
the AI lab's hacker group would be wiped out, but it was.</p>

<p> So Symbolics came up with a plan <a href="#foot-4">(4)</a>.  They
said to the lab, &ldquo;We will continue making our changes to the
system available for you to use, but you can't put it into
the MIT Lisp machine system. Instead, we'll give you
access to Symbolics' Lisp machine system, and you can run it, but
that's all you can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, in effect, meant that they demanded that we had to choose a
side, and use either the MIT version of the system or the
Symbolics version.  Whichever choice we made determined which system
our improvements went to. If we worked on and improved the Symbolics
version, we would be supporting Symbolics alone. If we used and
improved the MIT version of the system, we would be doing
work available to both companies, but Symbolics saw that we would be
supporting LMI because we would be helping them continue to exist. So
we were not allowed to be neutral anymore.</p>

<p>Up until that point, I hadn't taken the side of either company,
although it made me miserable to see what had happened to our
community and the software.  But now, Symbolics had forced the issue.
So, in an effort to help keep Lisp Machines
Inc. going <a href="#foot-5">(5)</a> &mdash; I began duplicating all
of the improvements Symbolics had made to the Lisp machine system.  I
wrote the equivalent improvements again myself (i.e., the code was my
own).</p>

<p>After a while <a href="#foot-6">(6)</a>, I came to the conclusion
that it would be best if I didn't even look at their code. When they
made a beta announcement that gave the release notes, I would see what
the features were and then implement them. By the time they had a real
release, I did too.</p>

<p>In this way, for two years, I prevented them from wiping out Lisp
Machines Incorporated, and the two companies went on. But, I didn't
want to spend years and years punishing someone, just thwarting an
evil deed. I figured they had been punished pretty thoroughly because
they were stuck with competition that was not leaving or going to
disappear <a href="#foot-7">(7)</a>. Meanwhile, it was time to start
building a new community to replace the one that their actions and
others had wiped out.</p>

<p>The Lisp community in the 70s was not limited to
the MIT AI Lab, and the hackers were not all
at MIT. The war that Symbolics started was what wiped
out MIT, but there were other events going on then. There
were people giving up on cooperation, and together this wiped out the
community and there wasn't much left.</p>

<p>Once I stopped punishing Symbolics, I had to figure out what to do
next. I had to make a free operating system, that was clear &mdash; the
only way that people could work together and share was with a free
operating system.</p>

<p>At first, I thought of making a Lisp-based system, but I realized
that wouldn't be a good idea technically. To have something like the
Lisp machine system, you needed special purpose microcode. That's what
made it possible to run programs as fast as other computers would run
their programs and still get the benefit of typechecking. Without
that, you would be reduced to something like the Lisp compilers for
other machines. The programs would be faster, but unstable. Now that's
okay if you're running one program on a timesharing system &mdash; if one
program crashes, that's not a disaster, that's something your program
occasionally does. But that didn't make it good for writing the
operating system in, so I rejected the idea of making a system like
the Lisp machine.</p>

<p>I decided instead to make a Unix-like operating system that would
have Lisp implementations to run as user programs. The kernel wouldn't
be written in Lisp, but we'd have Lisp. So the development of that
operating system, the GNU operating system, is what led me to write
the GNU Emacs. In doing this, I aimed to make the absolute minimal
possible Lisp implementation. The size of the programs was a
tremendous concern.</p>

<p>There were people in those days, in 1985, who had one-megabyte
machines without virtual memory. They wanted to be able to use GNU
Emacs. This meant I had to keep the program as small as possible.</p>

<p>For instance, at the time the only looping construct was
&lsquo;while&rsquo;, which was extremely simple. There was no way to
break out of the &lsquo;while&rsquo; statement, you just had to do a
catch and a throw, or test a variable that ran the loop. That shows
how far I was pushing to keep things small. We didn't have
&lsquo;caar&rsquo; and &lsquo;cadr&rsquo; and so on; &ldquo;squeeze
out everything possible&rdquo; was the spirit of GNU Emacs, the spirit
of Emacs Lisp, from the beginning.</p>

<p>Obviously, machines are bigger now, and we don't do it that way
any more. We put in &lsquo;caar&rsquo; and &lsquo;cadr&rsquo; and so
on, and we might put in another looping construct one of these
days. We're willing to extend it some now, but we don't want to extend
it to the level of common Lisp. I implemented Common Lisp once on the
Lisp machine, and I'm not all that happy with it. One thing I don't
like terribly much is keyword arguments <a href="#foot-8">(8)</a>.
They don't seem quite Lispy
to me; I'll do it sometimes but I minimize the times when I do
that.</p>

<p>That was not the end of the GNU projects involved with Lisp. Later
on around 1995, we were looking into starting a graphical desktop
project. It was clear that for the programs on the desktop, we wanted
a programming language to write a lot of it in to make it easily
extensible, like the editor. The question was what it should be.</p>

<p>At the time, <abbr title="Tool Command Language">TCL</abbr>
was being pushed heavily for this purpose. I had a very low opinion
of TCL, basically because it wasn't Lisp. It looks
a tiny bit like Lisp, but semantically it isn't, and it's not as
clean.  Then someone showed me an ad where Sun was trying to hire
somebody to work on TCL to make it the
&ldquo;de-facto standard extension language&rdquo; of the world. And I
thought, &ldquo;We've got to stop that from happening.&rdquo; So we
started to make Scheme the standard extensibility language for
GNU. Not Common Lisp, because it was too large. The idea was that we
would have a Scheme interpreter designed to be linked into
applications in the same way TCL was linked into
applications. We would then recommend that as the preferred
extensibility package for all GNU programs.</p>

<p>There's an interesting benefit you can get from using such a
powerful language as a version of Lisp as your primary extensibility
language.  You can implement other languages by translating them into
your primary language. If your primary language
is TCL, you can't very easily implement Lisp by
translating it into TCL. But if your primary
language is Lisp, it's not that hard to implement other things by
translating them. Our idea was that if each extensible application
supported Scheme, you could write an implementation
of TCL or Python or Perl in Scheme that translates
that program into Scheme. Then you could load that into any
application and customize it in your favorite language and it would
work with other customizations as well.</p>

<p>As long as the extensibility languages are weak, the users have to
use only the language you provided them. Which means that people who
love any given language have to compete for the choice of the
developers of applications &mdash; saying &ldquo;Please, application
developer, put my language into your application, not his
language.&rdquo; Then the users get no choices at all &mdash; whichever
application they're using comes with one language and they're stuck
with [that language]. But when you have a powerful language that can
implement others by translating into it, then you give the user a
choice of language and we don't have to have a language war
anymore. That's what we're hoping &lsquo;Guile&rsquo;, our scheme
interpreter, will do. We had a person working last summer finishing up
a translator from Python to Scheme. I don't know if it's entirely
finished yet, but for anyone interested in this project, please get in
touch. So that's the plan we have for the future.</p>

<p>I haven't been speaking about free software, but let me briefly
tell you a little bit about what that means. Free software does not
refer to price; it doesn't mean that you get it for free. (You may
have paid for a copy, or gotten a copy gratis.) It means that you have
freedom as a user. The crucial thing is that you are free to run the
program, free to study what it does, free to change it to suit your
needs, free to redistribute the copies of others and free to publish
improved, extended versions. This is what free software means. If you
are using a non-free program, you have lost crucial freedom, so don't
ever do that.</p>

<p>The purpose of the GNU project is to make it easier for people to
reject freedom-trampling, user-dominating, non-free software by
providing free software to replace it. For those who don't have the
moral courage to reject the non-free software, when that means some
practical inconvenience, what we try to do is give a free alternative
so that you can move to freedom with less of a mess and less of a
sacrifice in practical terms. The less sacrifice the better. We want
to make it easier for you to live in freedom, to cooperate.</p>

<p>This is a matter of the freedom to cooperate. We're used to
thinking of freedom and cooperation with society as if they are
opposites. But here they're on the same side. With free software you
are free to cooperate with other people as well as free to help
yourself. With non-free software, somebody is dominating you and
keeping people divided. You're not allowed to share with them, you're
not free to cooperate or help society, anymore than you're free to
help yourself.  Divided and helpless is the state of users using
non-free software.</p>

<p>We've produced a tremendous range of free software. We've done what
people said we could never do; we have two operating systems of free
software. We have many applications and we obviously have a lot
farther to go. So we need your help. I would like to ask you to
volunteer for the GNU project; help us develop free software for more
jobs. Take a look at <a href="/help/">http://www.gnu.org/help</a> to
find suggestions for how to help. If you want to order things, there's
a link to that from the home page. If you want to read about
philosophical issues, look in /philosophy. If you're looking for free
software to use, look in /directory, which lists about 1900 packages
now (which is a fraction of all the free software out there). Please
write more and contribute to us. My book of essays, &ldquo;Free
Software and Free Society&rdquo;, is on sale and can be purchased at

     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the

     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).

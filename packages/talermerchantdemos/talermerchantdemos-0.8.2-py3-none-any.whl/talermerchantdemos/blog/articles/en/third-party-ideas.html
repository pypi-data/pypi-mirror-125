speak for the GNU project &mdash; but we more or less agree with them.</p>

<li>Some economists argue that copyright and patents <a
href="https://reason.com/2003/03/01/creation-myths-2/"> fail to promote
the progress</a> that they supposedly exist to promote.
<p>
This article takes a narrowly economic view of its subject, measuring
social alternatives only by what goods are available for what price,
assuming that you the citizen are a mere consumer and place no value
on your freedom in itself.  It also uses the misleading term
<a href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty">&ldquo;intellectual
property&rdquo;</a>, which is misleading because it lumps copyrights and
patents together.  The article also lumps them together, which it can
get away with because it ignores the (different) social issues that
copyrights and patents raise.
</p><p>
Despite those flaws, it is significant. If one can judge copyright to
be harmful even on narrow economic terms, disregarding the ethical
wrong of stopping people from sharing, it can only be more harmful
once we consider the ethics as well.

  <li>Two articles by Duncan Campbell describe how NSA backdoors were
  hidden in proprietary software programs:
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723003646/http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/2/2898/1.html">Only NSA can
  listen, so that's OK</a> and <a
  href="https://www.heise.de/tp/features/How-NSA-access-was-built-into-Windows-3444341.html">How NSA
  access was built into Windows</a>.  Both are clear demonstrations of how

  <li>Peruvian Congressman Dr. Edgar David Villanueva Nu&ntilde;ez wrote a

   letter to the editor of the Communications of the ACM (vol.3, no.4,
   pp.A12-A13), saying in part (mentioning price, but clearly implying
   freedom):
   <blockquote>
     <p>
     &hellip; it is clear that what is being
     charged for is the development of the program, and
     while I am particularly unhappy that it comes from a
     university, I believe it is damaging to the whole
     profession. There isn't a 704 installation that hasn't
     directly benefited from the free exchange of programs
     made possible by the distribution facilities of SHARE.
     If we start to sell our programs, this will set very
     undesirable precedents.

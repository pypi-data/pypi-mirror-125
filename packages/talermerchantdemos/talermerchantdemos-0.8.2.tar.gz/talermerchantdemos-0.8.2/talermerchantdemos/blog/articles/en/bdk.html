<h2>The Ballad of Dennis Karjala</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A political comment in the form of a broadside ballad,
by Timothy R. Phillips</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>Come all you brave songwriters, and listen unto me,<br />
I'll tell you of a man who fought all for our liberty.<br />
With nothing but a web site and a stout heart in his breast,<br />
he fought the Disney company and the greedy Gershwin Trust.</p>

<p>
It wasn't many years ago, in nineteen and seventy-eight,<br />
they added nineteen years onto the term of copyright;<br />
then said the movie barons and the proud high-lords of song,<br />
&ldquo;our copyrights will suit us well if they can last this long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when the nineteen extra years were nearly past and done,<br />
those same proud barons then returned with cash to Washington.<br />
&ldquo;We want another twenty years, we hate the public domain.<br />
And here's some cash that you can use to fund your next campaign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then up spoke Dennis Karjala in Arizona's land,<br />
&ldquo;Rise up, rise up my merry men! for we must take our stand<br />
all for the Constitution, or the lords of copyright<br />
will steal away our books and music in their haughty might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then up rose Dennis's merry men, they gathered to his cause:<br />
The wise man Peter Jaszi, well learned in the laws;<br />
and Mary Brandt, the valiant maid from Mississippi's land,<br />
with a hundred alligators that all wait on her command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Congressmen, you are deceived! the lords of Hollywood<br />
have made you to forget your oath to serve the common good.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Hush you, Dennis Karjala, your egghead words are rash.<br />
We'll listen to the film-lords, and to their ready cash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas for us, my merry men! the Congress is beguiled,<br />
the public domain is put to nought, and freedom is reviled.<br />
Now let us warn the people with a web-page on the net.<br />
Though our proud foes are mighty, perhaps we'll beat them yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Dennis posts his web-page on a node in cyber-space<br />
and Mary Brandt with her alligators back in her own place,<br />
launches a web-wide mailing list where messages will run,<br />
that the evil that the song-lords plan might somehow be undone.</p>

<p>The President sits in his house with an Intern at his feet,<br />
and a Congresswoman comes to him with words so honey-sweet.<br />
The President, he signs the bill: for twenty years more by law,<br />
song-barons will suck the public's life into their greedy maw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas for us, my merry men, alas for the public domain.<br />
The people's right is thrown aside all for the film-lords' gain.<br />
But let us fight on 'til the day the barons in their greed<br />
are cast down from their seat, and song and letters will be freed.&rdquo;</p>

  <li>The <a

    Internet Empowerment Coalition</a> at the Wayback Machine (archived April
    24, 1999) came together to oppose Congress' first attempt to regulate
    material published on the Internet, the Communications Decency Act, which
    the U.S. Supreme Court found unconstitutional on June 26, 1997. Their site
    is being preserved as a resource on the landmark CDA case.</li>

  <li>
    <a href="/philosophy/censoring-emacs.html">Censoring GNU Emacs</a>
    describes how the Communications Decency Act required the GNU
    Project to censor GNU Emacs&mdash;and how this paradoxically had
    the opposite of the effect that the censors wanted.

    You can read <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011201050533/http://www.vtw.org/speech/">the
    June 1996 appeals court decision</a> at the Wayback Machine (archived
    December 01, 2001) rejecting censorship of the Internet. But remember, this
    decision is <em>not</em> final! First, the Supreme Court will agree or
    disagree; then Congress gets a chance to look for another method of
    censorship.</li>

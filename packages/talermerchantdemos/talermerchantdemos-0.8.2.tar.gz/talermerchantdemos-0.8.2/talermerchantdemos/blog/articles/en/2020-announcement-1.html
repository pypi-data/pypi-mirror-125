<h2>GNU-FSF cooperation update</h2>

<p>The Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project leadership are
defining how these two separate groups cooperate.  Our mutual aim is
to work together as peers, while minimizing change in the practical
aspects of this cooperation, so we can advance in our common free
software mission.</p>

<p>Alex Oliva, Henry Poole and John Sullivan (<a
href="https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board">board members
or officers of the FSF</a>), and Richard Stallman (head
of the GNU Project), have been meeting to develop a general framework
which will serve as the foundation for further discussion about
specific areas of cooperation.  Together we have been considering the
input received from the public on <a
href="mailto:fsf-and-gnu@fsf.org">&lt;fsf-and-gnu@fsf.org&gt;</a> and
<a href="mailto:gnu-and-fsf@gnu.org">&lt;gnu-and-fsf@gnu.org&gt;</a>.
We urge people to send any further input by February 13, because we
expect to finish this framework soon.</p>

<!-- Regarding copyright, in general, standalone pages (as opposed to
     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 4.0.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->

<h2>Posting Videos</h2>

<address class="byline">by Richard Stallman</address>
<hr class="thin" />

<p>You don't need a &ldquo;free software based streaming platform&rdquo;
to post a video for streaming.</p>

<p>Someone asked me where to upload a video recording on some &ldquo;free
software based streaming platform.&rdquo; Here's how I responded.</p>

<ul>
<li>
What software the <em>platform</em> is based on is not crucial,
because that has no effect on the people who use that site.
They don't run that software. What they do is talk with the site.</li>

<li>
The crucial question for the users' freedom is whether the site
requires them, or leads them, to run any nonfree software,
including nonfree JavaScript code.</li>

<li>
Any web site can host a file of video in such a way that any browser
can view it without <em>any</em> JavaScript. Just put the file of
video onto the site, and tell people its URL. Any modern graphical
browser, when it encounters a file of video, will stream it.</li>

<li>
The only special thing about &ldquo;video platform&rdquo; sites is
that they have other auxiliary facilities, such as making accounts,
uploading videos, tracking users who watch them, and restricting those
users. You don't need those things.</li>

<li>
To distribute the URL of the video and enable users to watch it,
all you do need is a site that you can post the file on.
It could be your own web site, either running on your own server or hosted
elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the rest of that site, it may have other flaws or moral
problems, but it will at least avoid directly mistreating users who
watch the video.</p>

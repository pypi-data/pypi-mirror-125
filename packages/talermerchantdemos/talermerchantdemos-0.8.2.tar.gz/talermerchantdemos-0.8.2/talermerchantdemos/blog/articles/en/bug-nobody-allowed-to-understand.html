<h2>The Bug Nobody is Allowed to Understand</h2>

<p>by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a></p>

<p>In the 1980s, proprietary software users discovered the problem of
<em>the bug that nobody is allowed to understand</em>. When a problem
occurs in the interaction of multiple proprietary software packages
with different developers, none of them is allowed to study the source
code of all the pertinent programs. As a result, none of them can
understand the bad interaction between them, and the bug is never
fixed except by accident.</p>

<p>According to <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/may/30/former-it-salesman-voices-of-finance">
this article</a>, a similar problem now occurs between
multiple instances of

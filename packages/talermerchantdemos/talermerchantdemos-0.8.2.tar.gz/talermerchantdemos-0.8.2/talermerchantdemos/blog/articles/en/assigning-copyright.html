<h2>When a Company Asks For Your Copyright</h2>

<p>Companies that develop free software and release it under the GNU GPL
sometimes distribute some copies of the code in other ways.  If they
distribute the exact same code under a different license to certain
users that pay for this, typically permitting including the code in
proprietary programs, we call it &ldquo;selling exceptions&rdquo;.  If they
distribute some version of the code solely in a proprietary manner, we
call that releasing a purely proprietary version of the program.</p>

<p><a href="/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html</a> explains why
selling exceptions is acceptable, though only barely.  By contrast,
releasing a purely proprietary version is outright wrong, like
any other proprietary software.</p>

<p>Companies normally do these things using code they
developed.  Since they hold the copyright on that code, they can
legally distribute it in any manner, even in multiple manners in
parallel.  But what happens when you publish a modified version of
that free program, and the company wants to include your changes in
its version?</p>

<p>Since you got the program under the GPL, when you distribute a
modified version you have to license it under the GPL.  If the company
receives a copy, it will be able to use those changes under the GPL;
it won't be allowed to include your changes in that program and sell
exceptions for it.  It also won't be able to release purely
proprietary versions containing your code.  If this is the outcome you
want, you get it by default.  However, if the company intends to sell
exceptions, it will probably decide not to use your changes.</p>

<p>Suppose, though, that you're not opposed to selling exceptions and
you're willing to let the company do so while including your changes
in the program.  You can agree to this, but you need to be careful
about what you sign, or you may be surprised by the results.</p>

<p>The company will probably invite you to assign or license your
copyright to the company, by signing a copyright assignment contract
or a contributor license agreement.  That in itself is not inherently bad; for
instance, many GNU software developers have assigned copyrights
to the FSF.  However, the FSF never sells exceptions, and its
assignment contracts include a commitment to distribute the
contributor's code only with source and only permitting
redistribution.</p>

<p>The company's proposed contract may not include such a commitment.  It
might instead let the company use your changes any way it likes.  If
you sign that, the company could do various things with your code.  It
could keep selling exceptions for a program including your code.  It
could release purely proprietary modified or extended versions
including your code.  It could even include your code <em>only</em> in
proprietary versions.  Your contribution of code could turn out to be,
in effect, a donation to proprietary software.</p>

<p>It is up to you which of these activities to permit, but here are the
FSF's recommendations.  If you plan to make major contributions to the
project, insist that the contribution agreement require that software
versions including your contributions be available to the public under
a free software license.  This will allow the developer to sell
exceptions, but prevent it from using your contributions in software
that is only available under a proprietary license.</p>

<p>If your contributions are smaller, you could accept a weaker
condition, that the company make your contributions available in a
free software release as well as possibly in nonfree programs.
This would allow the company to use your contributions in
modified software that's only available under a proprietary license.
Releasing proprietary software is never a good thing, but if your
changes are smaller, it might be more important to improve the free
version than resist the nonfree versions.</p>

<p>You can control these outcomes by insisting on the proper conditions
in the contract.  To allow selling exceptions for the program that
contains your code, but refuse to let the company release purely
proprietary versions containing your code, you can insist on a
condition more or less like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any program based on (as defined in GNU General Public License
  version 3) Hacker's code that FOO distributes shall be made
  available by FOO under a) the &ldquo;GNU General Public License (GPL),
  version 2 or later&rdquo;, or b) the licensing in (a), above, but with &ldquo;2&rdquo;
  replaced by any higher existing GPL version number.  Provided FOO
  makes the program available as source code gratis to the public in
  this way, it may also distribute the identical program to some of
  its users under terms permitting them to link the program's code
  with nonfree code and release the combination in binary form under a
  license of their own choosing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, if what you object to is that some variant <em>of your code</em>
might be released solely in a proprietary version, you can insist on a
condition more or less like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any program based on (as defined in GNU General Public License
  version 3) Hacker's code that FOO distributes shall be made
  available by FOO under a) the &ldquo;GNU General Public License (GPL),
  version 2 or later&rdquo;, or b) the licensing in (a), above, but with &ldquo;2&rdquo;
  replaced by any higher existing GPL version number.  Provided FOO
  makes the program available as source code gratis to the public in
  this way, it may also distribute the same version of Hacker's code
  in other programs released under other licenses of its own choosing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the program is released under the GNU Affero GPL, then add &ldquo;Affero&rdquo;
before &ldquo;General&rdquo;, change &ldquo;GPL&rdquo; to &ldquo;AGPL&rdquo;, change &ldquo;2 or&rdquo; to &ldquo;3 or&rdquo;, and
it could make sense to replace &ldquo;that FOO distributes&rdquo; with &ldquo;that FOO
distributes, or deploys on a server accessible to users other than
FOO&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The FSF has had these texts reviewed by a lawyer, but you should get
your own legal advice before using them.</p>

<p>When a company says which of these conditions it will accept, that
will show you how far it plans to depart from the principles of free
software.  Then you can respond to ensure your work will contribute to
the free software community and not be diverted into proprietary
software.</p>

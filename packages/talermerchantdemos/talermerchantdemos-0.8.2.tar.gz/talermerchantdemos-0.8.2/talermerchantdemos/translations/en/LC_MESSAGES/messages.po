#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "1. Free/Libre Software"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "... in the area of computing, "
#~ "freedom means not using proprietary "
#~ "software"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "GNU Taler must be <a "
#~ "href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\">Free/Libre"
#~ " Software</a>. For merchants, Free/Libre "
#~ "Software prevents vendor lock-in meaning"
#~ " merchants can easily choose another "
#~ "service provider to process their "
#~ "payments. For countries, Free/Libre software"
#~ " means GNU Taler can not compromise"
#~ " sovereignty by imposing restrictions or"
#~ " requirements. And for exchange operators,"
#~ " transparency is crucial to satisfy "
#~ "<a "
#~ "href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle\">Kerckhoff's"
#~ " principle</a> and to establish public "
#~ "confidence."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Customers benefit from Free/Libre Software "
#~ "because anyone is free to modify "
#~ "the wallet software support additional "
#~ "platforms. The source code must be "
#~ "available and make it easy to "
#~ "verify that user-hostile features such"
#~ " as tracking or telemetry are absent."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "2. Protect the privacy of buyers"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "You deserve some privacy"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Privacy is most meaningful when it "
#~ "is guaranteed via technical measures, as"
#~ " opposed to mere policies. Without a"
#~ " technical layer providing privacy-by-"
#~ "default, financial transactions reveal "
#~ "unnecessary levels of personal or "
#~ "private data. This would be especially"
#~ " true when making micropayments for "
#~ "online publications. Thus, GNU Taler "
#~ "must protect the privacy of buyers "
#~ "to avoid facilitating totalitarian control "
#~ "over the population."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Limited private data, such as the "
#~ "shipping address for a physical "
#~ "delivery, may need to be collected "

#~ " this case, GNU Taler must enable "
#~ "deletion of such data as soon as"
#~ " it is no longer required."

#~ "As a payment system must comply "

#~ "designed to comply with these "
#~ "requirements. GNU Taler must provide an"
#~ " audit trail for investigators operating"
#~ " under the law. Furthermore, we "
#~ "consider levying of taxes as beneficial"
#~ " to society, and fair taxation "
#~ "requires income transparency. Thus, GNU "
#~ "Taler must enable authorities to track"
#~ " income."

#~ " efficient. Quite simply, efficiency means"
#~ " fewer things to break, and it "
#~ "means more transactions per second and"
#~ " lowers our environmental impact. "
#~ "Efficiency is also critical for GNU "
#~ "Taler to be used for micropayments. "
#~ "Therefore certain expensive primitives, such"
#~ " as proof-of-work, must not be"
#~ " used by GNU Taler."

#~ "It must be relatively easy for "

#~ " traditional financial systems are rather"
#~ " high and outside of our control. "
#~ "However, GNU Taler must minimize the "
#~ "technical burden for new competitors to"
#~ " enter the market. GNU Taler must "
#~ "enable a diverse set of operators, "
#~ "breaking up the current system where "
#~ "only a few global companies dominate "
#~ "the market. An example for a "
#~ "design choice that supports this is "
#~ "to split the whole system into "
#~ "smaller components that can be operated,"
#~ " developed and improved upon independently,"
#~ " instead of having one completely "
#~ "monolithic system."

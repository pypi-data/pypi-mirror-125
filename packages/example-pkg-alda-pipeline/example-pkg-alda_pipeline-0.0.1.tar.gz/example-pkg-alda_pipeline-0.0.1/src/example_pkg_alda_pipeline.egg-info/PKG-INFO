## What's has been done so far
We created ```.gtilab-ci.yml``` file where are definded all the stages and jobs listed in the Assignment file.

The project is a simple Python program using ```yfinance```, ```pandas``` and ```numpy``` as a requirement. It downloads, using Yahoo Finance APIs, the latest stock prices and volume order of Apple stock. A function able to compute returns (based on adj closes) is part of the front-end of the application.

Regarding the stages developed this is the current status:
| Stage            | Status                                                                                                           |

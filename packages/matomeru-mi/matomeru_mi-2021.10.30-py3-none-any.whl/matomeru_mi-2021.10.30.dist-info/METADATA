# Markdown-like Markup Interpreter

## Project goal
Initially the idea was to use Markdown for making ODT files which will be
compilant with GOST 7.32-2017. But as things were going the goal expanded
to making an ODT from markup file and a template directory.

## Installation and use
### Via git
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/Fe-Ti/matomeru-mi.git
```
Run install.sh script (on *BSD, *Linux and others):
```
./install.sh
```
If everything was left as default then running a command below creates a zip
archive with ODT structure:
```
matomeru-mi -if <input file> -of <output file>
```
For example
```
matomeru-mi -if README.md -of README.odt
```

### Via pip
Run:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade matomeru-mi
```
Then the package will be downloaded. The execution is simple:
```
python3 -m matomerumi -if <input file> -of <output file>
```

# BeatNet
This repository contains the source code and additional documentation of "BeatNet" music time analizer which is 2021's state of the art online joint beat/downbeat/meter tracking system. The original ISMIR paper can be found on the following link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03576

In addition to online beat/downbeat/meter tracking, we added madmom's DBN beat/downbeat inference model from offline usages. Note that for such purpose we still utilize BeatNet's neural network rather than that of Madmom which leads to better performance and significantly faster results.

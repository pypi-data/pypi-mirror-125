cct: Module with functions related to correlated color temperature calculations
===============================================================================
 :_CCT_MAX: (= 1e12), max. value that does not cause overflow problems. 

 :_CCT_LUT_PATH: Folder with Look-Up-Tables (LUT) for correlated color 
                 temperature calculation followings Ohno's method.

 :_CCT_LUT: Dict with LUTs.
 
 :_CCT_LUT_CALC: Boolean determining whether to force LUT calculation, even if
                 the LUT can be found in ./data/cctluts/.
                 
 :_CCT_CSPACE: default chromaticity space to calculate CCT and Duv in.
 
 :_CCT_CSPACE_KWARGS: nested dict with cspace parameters for forward and backward modes. 

 :calculate_lut(): Function that calculates the LUT for the ccts stored in 
                   ./data/cctluts/cct_lut_cctlist.dat or given as input 
                   argument. Calculation is performed for CMF set specified in
                   cieobs. Adds a new (temprorary) field to the _CCT_LUT dict.

 :calculate_luts(): Function that recalculates (and overwrites) LUTs in 
                    ./data/cctluts/ for the ccts stored in 
                    ./data/cctluts/cct_lut_cctlist.dat or given as input 
                    argument. Calculation is performed for all CMF sets listed 
                    in _CMF['types'].

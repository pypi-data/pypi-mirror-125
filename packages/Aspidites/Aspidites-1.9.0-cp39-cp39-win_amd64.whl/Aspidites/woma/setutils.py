The :class:`set` type brings the practical expressiveness of
set theory to Python. It has a very rich API overall, but lacks a
couple of fundamental features. For one, sets are not ordered. On top
of this, sets are not indexable, i.e, ``my_set[8]`` will raise an
:exc:`TypeError`. The :class:`IndexedSet` type remedies both of these
issues without compromising on the excellent complexity
characteristics of Python's built-in set implementation.

def complement(wrapped):
    """Given a :class:`set`, convert it to a **complement set**.

    Whereas a :class:`set` keeps track of what it contains, a
    `complement set
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)>`_ keeps
    track of what it does *not* contain. For example, look what
    happens when we intersect a normal set with a complement set::

    >>> list(set(range(5)) & complement(set([2, 3])))
    [0, 1, 4]

    We get the everything in the left that wasn't in the right,
    because intersecting with a complement is the same as subtracting
    a normal set.

    Args:
        wrapped (set): A set or any other iterable which should be
           turned into a complement set.

    All set methods and operators are supported by complement sets,
    between other :func:`complement`-wrapped sets and/or regular
    :class:`set` objects.

    Because a complement set only tracks what elements are *not* in
    the set, functionality based on set contents is unavailable:
    :func:`len`, :func:`iter` (and for loops), and ``.pop()``. But a
    complement set can always be turned back into a regular set by
    complementing it again:

    >>> s = set(range(5))
    >>> complement(complement(s)) == s
    True

    .. note::

       An empty complement set corresponds to the concept of a
       `universal set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_set>`_
       from mathematics.

    Complement sets by example
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Many uses of sets can be expressed more simply by using a
    complement. Rather than trying to work out in your head the proper
    way to invert an expression, you can just throw a complement on
    the set. Consider this example of a name filter::

        >>> class NamesFilter(object):
        ...    def __init__(self, allowed):
        ...        self._allowed = allowed
        ...
        ...    def filter(self, names):
        ...        return [name for name in names if name in self._allowed]
        >>> NamesFilter(set(['alice', 'bob'])).filter(['alice', 'bob', 'carol'])
        ['alice', 'bob']

    What if we want to just express "let all the names through"?

    We could try to enumerate all of the expected names::

       ``NamesFilter({'alice', 'bob', 'carol'})``

    But this is very brittle -- what if at some point over this
    object is changed to filter ``['alice', 'bob', 'carol', 'dan']``?

    Even worse, what about the poor programmer who next works
    on this piece of code?  They cannot tell whether the purpose
    of the large allowed set was "allow everything", or if 'dan'
    was excluded for some subtle reason.

    A complement set lets the programmer intention be expressed
    succinctly and directly::

       NamesFilter(complement(set()))

    Not only is this code short and robust, it is easy to understand
    the intention.

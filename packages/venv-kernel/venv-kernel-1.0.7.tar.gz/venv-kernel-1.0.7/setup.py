You want\nto be able to switch between them from within a _single_ jupyter\ninstallation. How do you do this?\n\nYou need a (user-) global jupyter installation. The recommended\napproach for that is to use `pipx` to install jupyter as a standalone\ntool. Jupyter can handle multiple different kernels, even for the same\npython version, and they are easily maintained with the `jupyter\nkernelspec` command. The only nuissance is to create and install the\nkernel.json files manually for each venv. That\'s where `venv-kernel`\ncomes in.\n\n## Suggested workflow ##\n\n### One-time setup ###\n\nIt is recommended to maintain your python versions with `pyenv` and\njupyter with `pipx`. Both of these packages can be installed with the\nusual package managers such as `apt-get` or `brew`.\n\nSpecifically, install and temporarily activate a recent python version\nwith pyenv, e.g., via\n```\npyenv install 3.9.10\npyenv shell 3.9.10\n```\nThen install jupyter using pipx as per\n```\npipx install --install-deps notebook jupyter jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n```\nwhich places it in its own virtual environment, all managed by\npipx. You can call jupyter from the command line now.\n\n### Install a custom kernel for a VENV ###\n\nEvery time you want to add a custom virtual environment as a kernel\noption to your jupyter notebook server, follow these steps:\n\n1. If you haven\'t done so yet, create and activate the venv as per usual, e.g., via\n    ```bash\n    pyenv shell 3.10 # we want to use this particular python version\n    pip -m venv .venv\n    . .venv/bin/activate\n    pip install --upgrade pip\n    pip install <list of packages here> or pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n2. Install venv-kernel as per\n    ```bash\n    pip install venv-kernel\n    ```\n3. Create and install the custom jupyter kernel\n    ```bash\n    venv-kernel install --name "MyProject" --description "Virtual Environment for MyProject using Python 3.10"\n    ```\n   Here the `--name` and `--description` are optional and default\n   to the direcory name of the virtual environment.\n4. Start/restart your jupyter notebook server. You should now see the\n   kernel "MyProject", which uses the Python version of your virtual\n   environment and has access to all the packages installed in it.\n    \n### Removal ###\n    \nIf for any reason you want to uninstall a kernel created by this\npackage, you can simply do so using the commands\n```bash\njupyter kernelspec list\n```\nto identify the kernel in question\nand then delete it via \n```bash\njupyter kernelspec remove\n```\n\nIf you are within a virtualenv that has `venv-kernel` installed, you\ncan also use\n```bash\nvenv-kernel list\n```\nto see if there\'s currently a kernel installed that corresponds to the current venv, and \n```bash\nvenv-kernel clean\n```\nto remove it.\n\n## Similar packages ##\n    \nThere are other packages that provide similar or related\nfunctionality, and these may or may not serve your purposes better\nthan this package, which is designed solely to meet the author\'s\nneeds.

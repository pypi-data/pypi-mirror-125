Description: # sphinx-resolve-py-references
        
        A sphinx extension that fixes or warns about missing references to Python objects
        
        The extension is useful because it's often annoying to write out the full path to an
        object in your docs which you know is imported in the current module. This is also true
        for neighboring modules which would be easier referenced with a relative name.
        
        This extension resolves these issues by allowing you to reference functions or classes
        which are imported in the current module as if they had been defined there and creates
        a backlink to their true location.
        
        ```python
        from some_package import MyClass
        
        def my_function():
            '''Uses :class:`MyClass`'''
            # The above reference would normally fail because `MyClass`
            # is not defined in this module. However this extension
            # automatically resolves the reference
        ```
        
        This is done by analyzing the AST to find ``import`` statements and trace them back to
        the place where the target was defined. This is more robust than looking at the
        ``__module__`` and ``__name__`` attributes of classes and functions because not all
        documentable objects have these properties (e.g. global variables).

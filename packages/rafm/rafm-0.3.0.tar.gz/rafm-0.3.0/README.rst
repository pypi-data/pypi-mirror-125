*rafm* computes per-model measures associated with atomic-level accuracy for
AlphaFold models from *pLDDT* confidence scores.  Outputs are to a
tab-separated file.


Installation
------------

You can install *rafm* via pip_ from PyPI_:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install rafm


Usage
-----
*rafm --help* lists all commands. Current commands are:

* *plddt-stats*
    Calculate stats on bounded pLDDTs from list of AlphaFold model files.
    in PDB format.

    Options:

        * *--criterion FLOAT*
            The cutoff value on truncated pLDDT for possible utility. [default: 91.2]
        * *--min-length INTEGER*
            The minimum sequence length for which to calculate truncated stats.
            [default: 20]
        * *--min-count INTEGER*
            The minimum number of truncated *pLDDT* values for which to calculate stats.
            [default: 20]
        * *--lower-bound INTEGER*
            The *pLDDT* value below which stats will not be calculated. [default: 80]
        * *--upper-bound INTEGER*
            The *pLDDT* value above which stats will not be calculated. [default: 100]
        * *--file-stem TEXT*
            Output file name stem. [default: rafm]

    Output columns (where *NN* is the bounds specifier, default: 80):

        * *residues_in_pLDDT*
            The number of residues in the AlphaFold model.
        * *pLDDT_mean*
            The mean value of pLDDT over all residues.
        * *pLDDT_median*
            The median value of pLDDT over all residues.
        * *pLDDTNN_count*
            The number of residues within bounds.
        * *pLDDTNN_frac*
            The fraction of pLDDT values within bounds, if the
            count is greater than the minimum.
        * *pLDDTNNN_mean*
            The mean of pLDDT values within bounds, if the
            count is greater than the minimum.
        * *pLDDTNN_median*
            The median of pLDDT values within bounds, if the
            count is greater than the minimum.
        * *LDDT_expect*
            The expectation value of global *LDDT* over the
            residues with *LDDT* within bounds.  Only
            produced if default bounds are used.
        * *passing*
            True if the model passed the criterion, False
            otherwise.  Only produced if default bounds are
            used.
        * *file*
            The path to the model file.

* *plddt-select-residues*
    Writes a tab-separated file of residues from passing models,
    using an input file of values selected by *plddt-stats*.
    Input options are the same as *plddt-stats*.

    Output columns:

        * *file*
            Path to the model file.
        * *residue*
            Residue number, starting from 0 and numbered
            sequentially.  Note that *all* residues will be
            written, regardless of bounds set.
        * *pLDDT*
            pLDDT value for that residue.

Statistical Basis
-----------------
The default parameters were chosen to select for *LDDT* values of greater
than 80 on a set of crystal structures obtained since AlphaFold was trained.  The
distributions of *LDDT* scores for the passing and non-passing sets, along
with an (overlapping) set of PDB files at 100% sequence identity over
at least 80% of the sequence looks like this:

   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unmtransinfo/rafm/master/docs/_static/lddt_dist.png
   :alt: Distribution of high-scoring, low-scoring, and high-similarity structures

The markers on the *x*-axis refer to the size of conformational changes observed in
conformational changes in various protein crystal structures:

* *CALM*
    Between calcum-bound and calcium-free calmodulin (depicted in the logo image above).
* *ERK2*
    Between unphosphorylated and doubly-phosphorylated ERK2 kinase.
* *HB*
    Between R- and T-state hemoglobin
* *MB*
    Between carbonmonoxy- and deoxy-myoglobin

When applied to set of "dark" genomes with no previous PDB entries, the distributions of
median *pLDDT* scores with a lower bound of 80 and per-residue *pLDDT* scores looks like
this:

Description: # Introduction
        
        Developed by Morteza Nazifi and Hamid Fadishei at University of Bojnord, Iran, Supsim is an open source software that helps study the two-predictor suppression effects via computerized simulations. Software developers can find the source code for the command-line Python pakcage of Supsim at [https://github.com/fadishei/supsim](https://github.com/fadishei/supsim). More information about this project can be found in [the project site](https://supsim.netlify.app).
        
        # Installation
        
        Supsim can be installed easily by using the Python 3 pip command:
        
            pip3 install supsim
        
        You can check whether the installation went ok by running the following command:
        
            supsim --help
        
        ## Troubleshooting
        
        If you get an error that says pip3 command is not available, then you should check your system to see if you have Python3 and pip installed:  
        
            python3 --version
            pip3 --version
        
        If you get an error, then you should install them. For example, Debian-based Linux users can run:
        
            sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
        
        Windows users should install Python 3 from the official site. They should also note that the command is usually python and pip (not python3 and pip3) in their environment
        
        If Supsim is installed without any error, but can not be executed from the command line after installation, make sure that you have the python distributed scripts executable path included in your operating system PATH environment variable. Linux users should usually add \$HOME/.local/bin to PATH, for example by adding this line to \$HOME/.bashrc file and re-open the terminal:
        
            export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
        
        Windows users should edit the system environment variable from Windows settings and add a path like C:\\Users\\\<Username\>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python\<Version\>\Scripts\ to PATH variable
        
        # Web-based Version
        
        A web-based Javascript implementation of supsim is also available at [the project site](https://supsim.netlify.app/supsim/). This link can be used to work with Supsim without any hassle.

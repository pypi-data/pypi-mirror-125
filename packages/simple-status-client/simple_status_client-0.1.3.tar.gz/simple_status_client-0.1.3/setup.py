Simply send a new configuration or status.  That being said if you have code in multiple places using the same id... they will be stepping on each other\n- This library is provided as a convenience, the REST API is full accessible and you can write your own interface if you would like.  \n  - I promise to keep this library up to date and working to the best of my ability.  Maybe I\'ll even write tests for it.',

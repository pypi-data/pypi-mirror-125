        ================
        
        `FLASk supported Http webCAM`
        
        IN DEVELOPMENT
        
        /Here, the merge of several ideas will form the package for easy
        installable webcam surveylance via PyPI. The basic aim is to access view
        to various technical devices during an experiment./
        
        Usage screen
        ------------
        
            ... usage:
                        flashcam ls
                        flashcam getres [product | IDpath ]        # flashcam getres "Webcam C270"
                        flashcam show [product | IDpath ] [-r res] # flashcam show  "Webcam C270"
                                                                       # flashcam show  "Webcam C270"  -r 320x176
        
                   ... cv2.V4L2 is used to avoid stuck while cap.read()
        
        Status:
        -------
        
        -   `usbcheck` can identify the camera by `product` or `IDpath`
        -   `v4l2` prove of concept - exposure/gain autotune - worked
        -   `show` (imshow) was tuned, now it needs a rewrite with `base_camera`
        -   `flask` interface is responsive
        -   `web.py` must be same with `flask5000` option
        -   `base_camera` (with greenlets) and `real_camera` modules work with
            flask
            -   initialized with `recommend`
            -   never-stopping (unlike the original version)
            -   more tricky tuning classmethod andstaticmethod was needed
        -   `flask` interface works
        -   gray frame is sent when no camera through web
        -   autostarts (threading) with `wget -u -p -O /dev/null` for 3 sec. and
            then kill
        -   properly taken `product` in `real_cam`
        -   rewrite proprerly for gunicorn (no gevent; --w 1 --t 5+); flashcam
            flask
        -   with automatic wget to start, with debugprint for gunicorn too
        -   !! `product` may not work now
        -   `stream_enhancer` decorations ON
        -   =detect motion basics ON -t threshold (0 - means NO)
        -   three modes -a 10 -b 3 -t 100 -f \[direct\|delta\|detect\]
        
        To see next
        -----------
        
        -   v4l2
        
        V4l2
        ----
        
        Camera sometimes needs to tune at dark conditions. Nicely done project
        to call `v4l2-ctrl` was used
        
        Identification of a camera
        --------------------------
        
        Several devices on USB, replugging or an built-in webcam of the notebok
        or sevral dev/video devices per CAM can make identification via
        `/dev/video` more difficult.

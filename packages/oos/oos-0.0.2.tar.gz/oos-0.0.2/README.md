> A basic framework for object-oriented sports analysis


### Object-Oriented Sports!

This package aims to build a very basic framework to perform sports analysis in a more object-oriented fashion

While data is frequently better suited for a Pandas DataFrame, An object-oriented framework allows for a more natural way to link together the nested structure of sporting events from the players to the plays to the games to the seasons.

This framework is built to be extensible by giving a simple way to transistion lists of objects to DataFrames and visa-versa.

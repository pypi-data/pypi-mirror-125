When a pipeline is execute first all `pre` actions\nof all Steps are executed, then `run` actions and so on. Steps can provide labels, so\nyou can easily disable/enable a subset of steps.\n\nA ready to use python app template. Based on `pipenv`.\n\n## How to use the library\n\n### BuildStep\n\nThe most important basic class is [BuildStep](step_exec_lib/steps.py). The class is abstract\nand you have to inherit from it to provide any actual functionality.  The most important methods and properties of\nthis class are:\n\n* Each `BuildStep` provides a set of step names it is associated with in the `steps_provided` property.\n  These steps are used for filtering with `--steps`/`--skip-steps` command line options.\n* `initialize_config` provides additional config options a specific class delivered from `BuildStep`\n  wants to provide.\n* `pre_run` is optional and should be used for validation and assertions. `pre_runs` of all `BuildSteps` are executed\n  before any `run` method is executed. Its purpose is to allow the `abs`\n  to quit with error even before any actual build or tests are done. The method can't be blocking and should run\n  fast. If `pre_step` of any `BuildStep` fails, `run` methods of all `BuildSteps` are skipped.\n* `run` is the method where actual long-running actions of the `BuildStep` are executed.\n* `cleanup` is an optional method used to clean up resources that might have been needed by `run` but can't be cleaned\n  up until all `runs` have executed. `cleanups` are called after any `run` failed or all of them are done.\n\n### BuildStepsFilteringPipeline\n\n`BuildStep` class provides the `steps_provided` property, but is not in control of whether it should be executed or not\nand when. `BuildSteps` have to be assembled into `pipelines`. The basic pipeline in `BuildStepsFilteringPipeline`, which\nallows you to make a sequential pipeline out of your steps and filter and skip them according to `steps_provided` they\nreturn and command line options `--steps`/`--skip-steps`. Each major part of `abs` execution is combined into a\npipeline, like `HelmBuildFilteringPipeline` used to execute build pipeline with Helm 3 or `PytestTestFilteringPipeline`\nwhich is used to execute tests using `pytest` once the build pipeline is done.\n",

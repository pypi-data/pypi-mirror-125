nz-stream-depletion
==================================

This package contains a class and various functions for calculating stream depletion from pumping wells.
The stream depletion functions used in this package are derived from groundwater analytical solutions. Most of these were originally developed to support New Zealand regional councils in their water resource management. The methods in this python package are essentially transcribed from Excel VBA macros written by `Bruce Hunt <https://sites.google.com/site/brucehuntsgroundwaterwebsite/>`_. Matt Smith at Environment Canterbury created an `excel spreadsheet <https://api.ecan.govt.nz/TrimPublicAPI/documents/download/3027564>`_ that has built upon Bruce Hunt's spreadsheet to be more user-friendly.

The main documentation website can be found `here <http://nz-stream-depletion.readthedocs.io>`_.

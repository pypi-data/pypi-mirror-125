Topologically associating domains (TADs) are contiguous segments of the genome where the genomic elements are in frequent contact with each other. The TAD Map provides a consensus estimate, aggregated from multiple experimental datasets, of this layout in human and mouse. It also provides tools to map any single-cell RNA-seq dataset to TAD signatures, with gene expression mapped to TAD activation probabilities in each cell

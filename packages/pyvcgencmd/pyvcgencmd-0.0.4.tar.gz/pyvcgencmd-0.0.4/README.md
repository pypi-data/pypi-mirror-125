# Python Vcgencmd Wrapper

Python Wrapper for BCM (Raspberry Pi) vcgencmd.

This project initially created for AzatAI Xlink Clusters, where we use Raspbeery Pis as a node for our kubernets classters. They worked very well, to control and monitor the rpi nodes, we then created this package.

This package is also used in many other projects where RPi is a means of central computational power.



Still experimental.

# Teflo Notify Service Plugin

This is Teflo's plugin for sending teflo notifications using Notify Service. Notify service is a 
backend service build with FastAPI that supports sending notifications to multiple supported targets
(gchat, slack, unified message bus, email and irc)

This plugin is used to send notifications on triggers like `on_task`, `on_start`, `on_failure`, `on_demand`
during and post teflo execution. For more information on how to setup triggers for notification
please visit [here](https://teflo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/definitions/notifications.html#triggers).

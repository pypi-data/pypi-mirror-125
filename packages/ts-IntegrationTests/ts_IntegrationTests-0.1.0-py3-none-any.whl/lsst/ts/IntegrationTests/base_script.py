    Notes
    -----
    Use index=1 for MainTel, 2 for AuxTel. The index is defined as a class
    attribute for simplicity.  The sub-Classes define which index,
    if necessary.
    The BaseScript class defaults to index=1, as the most common option.

    Attributes
    ----------
    index : `int`
        The index represents the Main Telescope, index=1, or the
        Auxilliary Telescope, index=2.
    configs : `tuple`
        The list of Yaml-formatted script configurations.
        They are stored in the configs.py module.
    scripts : `tuple`
        The list of Standard or External scripts to execute.

        ----------

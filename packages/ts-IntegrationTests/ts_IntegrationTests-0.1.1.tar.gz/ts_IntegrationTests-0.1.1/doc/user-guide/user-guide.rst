[This area should give an introduction to users, but at greater depth than the overview on the higher-level page. Some repetition is fine.
Discussion of high-level control classes (if applicable), primary use cases, links to any useful documentation etc can be included.
Reference to configurations may also be worthwhile]

Example Use-Case
================

[This area should walk the user through the standard use-case(s) for using the package.
This includes any required code, usage of certain commands/events etc.
Multiple code blocks will probably be necessary.]
